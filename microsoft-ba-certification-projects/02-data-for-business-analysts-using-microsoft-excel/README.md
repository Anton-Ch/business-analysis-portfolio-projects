## üìù Project Context

Adventure Works, a retail company, is preparing for a management meeting. Jamie, one of the managers, was assigned to prepare an Excel-based report that summarizes sales data for the first quarter and compares it against the same period of the previous year. The management team also requested a detailed breakdown of sales performance by product lines for further discussion.

As a Business Analyst, I was tasked with:
- Preparing and transforming raw sales data for executive presentation
- Applying calculations to summarize quarter sales and monthly breakdowns
- Performing year-over-year comparisons and percentage growth calculations
- Creating a PivotTable report for deeper analysis by product categories
- Structuring an interactive report suitable for managerial decision-making
