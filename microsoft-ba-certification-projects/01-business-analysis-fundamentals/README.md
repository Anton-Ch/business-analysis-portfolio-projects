## 📝 Project Context

Northwind Trading, a mid-size eCommerce company, experienced a **sudden decline in monthly sales** and a wave of **negative customer feedback** on social media. The company suspects the issue may be related to a recent website redesign, which introduced a mandatory registration step during checkout.

As a Business Analyst, I was tasked with:
- Investigating the situation using quantitative and qualitative analysis
- Identifying the root cause
- Making evidence-based recommendations
- Analyzing users and stakeholders
- Allocating project responsibilities using a RACI matrix

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Perform **quantitative analysis** using Excel  
- Conduct **qualitative feedback analysis** and categorization  
- Apply **root cause analysis** (5 Whys technique)  
- Build **User Role Analysis** to capture distinct system interactions  
- Conduct **stakeholder identification, influence mapping, and prioritization**  
- Create a clear **RACI matrix** for assigning project roles and responsibilities  
- Synthesize findings into **actionable business insights**

## 📌 Solution Summary

- **Quantitative analysis** revealed a sharp decline in sales and transaction volume after the checkout redesign.
- **Customer complaint analysis** showed checkout friction as the dominant issue (57% of total complaints).
- **5 Whys root cause analysis** linked the issue to a reactive attempt to improve retention through forced registration, introduced without proper UX validation.
- **User Role Analysis** defined distinct user personas interacting with the site.
- **Stakeholder mapping** helped prioritize communication and influence strategies.
- A **RACI Matrix** ensured alignment of roles and responsibilities for the planned redesign project.
