## 📌 Overview

This folder showcases my work throughout the Microsoft Business Analyst Professional Certificate — a comprehensive training path that includes 6 practical, simulation-based courses. Each course concludes with a capstone-style project simulating a real-world business scenario.

The program is focused on building job-ready skills by combining theory, tools, and application — and these projects reflect my ability to analyze, model, and communicate business needs clearly and professionally.
